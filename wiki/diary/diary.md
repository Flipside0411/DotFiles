Well the day has come to head back to work. It will be interesting to see how
the casino will be setup for both players and employees. I also want see who
is working for the company.

Last day of freedom from work, lol, tomorrow I start back to work for the casino.
I'm looking forward to getting back to work. It is almost two and still haven't
seen my monitor stand, it is to be delivered by UPS. Amazon is not meeting up
with it's delivery listing. My monitor stand said it would be delivered the
next day and it has been over two weeks now.
Christy got German take out for dinner, it was very good and super filling.

Today I uploaded the request for Christy to be added to the savings account at
USAA. USAA said that it should take seven to ten days for it to take effect.
Will have to follow up. Yesterday for some reason I'm not sure but my lenovo
laptop locked up and was unable to boot into the system. I have to do a fresh
install of POP Os and now I have to start the process of reloading all the
applications and settings.

Got a call from Josh about starting work on the 18th. Still working the swing
shift but my new days off will be Wednesday & Thursday. The first week will be
a six day week due to they want all staff in a day before the casino opens up
on Friday the 19th. It will be good to get back to work again. So I have a week
till I go back, so I need to get some things that I should have been doing
while I have been sitting around playing XBox. I need to get back into work
mode, it's going to be a little off for awhile because both Christy and I will
be working different shifts but we'll make it work. I guess we can look at it
as a way for us to save money. WE have a lot of new bills to pay, two Car
payments, and all the extras.

I have started setting up vimwiki for both my notes and journalizing/diary from within

over all my computers to Linux the only computer that I'll keep windows on will
be the surface go.

I have installed Rambox, Gnome tweeks, WPS,
