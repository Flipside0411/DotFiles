  Got a call from Josh about starting work on the 18th. Still working the swing shift 
  but my new days off will be Wednesday & Thursday. The first week will be a six day week 
  due to they want all staff in a day before the casino opens up on Friday the 19th. It
  will be good to get back to work again.  So I have a week till I go back, so I need to 
  get some things that I should have been doing while I have been sitting around playing
  XBox.  I need to get back into work mode, it's going to be a little off for awhile because
  both Christy and I will be working different shifts but we'll make it work.  I guess we can
  look at it as a way for us to save money.  *WE* have a lot of new bills to pay, two Car payments,
  and all the extras.

  I have started setting up vimwiki for both my notes and journaling/diary from within
  wiki. I'm going to start tracking how I setup all my systems.  Now that I have changed 
  over all my computers to Linux the only computer that I'll keep windows on will be the 
  surface go. 
 
I have installed Rambox, Gnome tweeks, WPS,
