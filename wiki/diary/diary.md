Today I worked on setting up my NAS server with the Pi 3B+. I'm trying to also
setup the 8Gb pi with Kali but it's giving me some issues with setting up VNC
so that I can remote with full GUI. I have started to also work on my
documentation using Notion.

Well this week at work has been crazy with the amount of reports that I've had

**July 2, 2020**
Today has been a good day, I got some thing I wanted to do done and did some
gaming on the xbox. Christy and I had Chinese food from China Bell our normal
dinner. Some how today I strained a muscles in my back not sure how that happened.
Still working on or should I say tweaking on my vim configuration file. I really
need to finish my Linux class and start working on the Python class. I need to
also sit down and set some goals for the second half of the year. With all of
this Covid-19 situation going on I really don't know how the rest of the year
will go.

**July 1, 2020**
The first day of July, this year is going so fast, before long it's going to
start getting cold again. I'm not looking forward to that.

Today is the first day of me being a dual rate supervisor, it makes me a little
nervus taking on this responsibility I'm sure that I can do the job but I'm
still uncertain of all actions in given situations. I will get through it and
grow to be a better at surveillance operations within this company, but I have
to admit from what little I have seen, this company is much better than the
last one I worked for. With Richard set to leave on July 16th and the
uncertainty of who will take over as Surveillance Manager and how that person
will run the department makes for some stress in side of the department. It
just makes what the future holds up in the air.

First day off, I got Kathryn's birthday gift in from Amazon today, I hope that
she likes it. She said that she wanted a wireless headset for her phone but
didn't want airpods, she wanted the old school kind.

Finishing up my first week of work, it has been pretty easy to get back in the
swing of work. It's still the same old stuff that goes on at any Casino, it's
just the procedures that are different. It also looks like I might be promoted
to assistant shift supervisor. It will be a small pay increase but that answer
will not be until next week. So we'll see what happens. Sitting here looking
at pictures of all my grandkids and it makes my heart full, I might not have
done any good in this world but I did help bring in two very beautiful and smart
daughters. They are my best achievements I could ever wish for.

**Jun 18, 2020**
Well the day has come to head back to work. It will be interesting to see how
the casino will be setup for both players and employees. I also want see who
is working for the company.

**Jun 17, 2020**
Last day of freedom from work, lol, tomorrow I start back to work for the casino.
I'm looking forward to getting back to work. It is almost two and still haven't
seen my monitor stand, it is to be delivered by UPS. Amazon is not meeting up
with it's delivery listing. My monitor stand said it would be delivered the
next day and it has been over two weeks now.
Christy got German take out for dinner, it was very good and super filling.

- Received mats for car
- Received monitor stand

So I cleaned the kitchen, floors, picked up mail, finished setting up my
shoulder bag for work.

**Jun 15, 2020**
Today I uploaded the request for Christy to be added to the savings account at
USAA. USAA said that it should take seven to ten days for it to take effect.
Will have to follow up. Yesterday for some reason I'm not sure but my lenovo
laptop locked up and was unable to boot into the system. I have to do a fresh
install of POP Os and now I have to start the process of reloading all the
applications and settings.

Saturday**
Today I did the wash and worked on some code within my zshrc/vim init files.

**Jun 11, 2020**
Got a call from Josh about starting work on the 18th. Still working the swing
shift but my new days off will be Wednesday & Thursday. The first week will be
a six day week due to they want all staff in a day before the casino opens up
on Friday the 19th. It will be good to get back to work again. So I have a week
till I go back, so I need to get some things that I should have been doing
while I have been sitting around playing XBox. I need to get back into work
mode, it's going to be a little off for awhile because both Christy and I will
be working different shifts but we'll make it work. I guess we can look at it
as a way for us to save money. WE have a lot of new bills to pay, two Car
payments, and all the extras.

**Jun 8, 2020**
Setting up all my bags for [EDC](EDC).

**Jun 5, 2020**
I have started setting up vimwiki for both my notes and journalizing/diary from within
wiki. I'm going to start tracking how I setup all my systems. Now that I have changed
over all my computers to Linux the only computer that I'll keep windows on will
be the surface go.

I have installed Rambox, Gnome tweeks, WPS,
